# To Do List

- Finish io and tools, and then test
- Split elements into a CSV with name, args, docstring, 
  to_json format, and a creator fn.
  This is akin to having a templating engine.
- Better docstring for partial functions:
  compare `help(panflute.Div)` with `help(panflute.Table)`.
  To fix, just set the `foobar.__doc__` attribute.
